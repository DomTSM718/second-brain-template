## Using Episodic Memory

### Recording (via /learn)
After completing significant work, run `/learn` to:
1. Capture what was done
2. Extract patterns
3. Document decisions
4. Create episodic record

### Recalling
Use `/recall [topic]` to search episodic memory for:
- Past solutions to similar problems
- Decisions and their outcomes
- Patterns discovered

### Context Restoration
Reference episodic memories to restore context in new conversations:
```
@memory/episodic/completed-work/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md
```

## Maintenance

### Weekly
- Review recent episodes
- Link patterns to semantic memory
- Archive old, irrelevant episodes

### Monthly
- Clean up duplicate information
- Update pattern confidence based on reuse
- Archive completed project episodes
